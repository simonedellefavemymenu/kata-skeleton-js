## KATA SKELETON - PHP VERSION

# FIZZ BUZZ

Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100, but with some exceptions:
- for all numbers that are multiples of 3, print “Fizz” instead of the number itself
- for all numbers that are multiples of 5, print “Buzz” instead of the number itself
- for all numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz” instead of the number itself

## Assigment

At the very minimum, write a program that solves the problem. Make it the best use you can of all the clean code principles you know, but also show us your habit on using GIT and everything else you tipically use. Feel free to add a section to this README to add some notes from your side.

Bonus/advanced objective:
- write automated tests that prove that the code solves the problems
- use TDD (use GIT in a good way to show the TDD Cycle by committing each step)

Feel free to use this repository as a template for your one, or fork from this: in this branch, you have a ready-to-use PHP project with a stupid class and its own stupid test, that you can use as a starting point for your solution. If you prefer another language or simply starting from scratch, feel free to do it, just be sure to copy this README file in the repository as a reference. Thanks!
